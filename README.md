# Theano-Practices
Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. Theano features:  tight integration with NumPy – Use numpy.ndarray in Theano-compiled functions. transparent use of a GPU – Perform data-intensive computations much faster than on a CPU. efficient symbolic differentiation – Theano does your derivatives for functions with one or many inputs. speed and stability optimizations – Get the right answer for log(1+x) even when x is really tiny. dynamic C code generation – Evaluate expressions faster. extensive unit-testing and self-verification – Detect and diagnose many types of errors. Theano has been powering large-scale computationally intensive scientific investigations since 2007. But it is also approachable enough to be used in the classroom (University of Montreal’s deep learning/machine learning classes).
